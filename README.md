Iris Flower Species Classification
A machine learning project to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on sepal and petal measurements. This project demonstrates a complete data science workflow and was completed for the Codsoft internship.

Key Features
Data Visualization: Explores feature relationships using seaborn and matplotlib.

Model Comparison: Trains and evaluates KNN, Logistic Regression, and SVM models.

Performance Tuning: Optimizes the best model (SVM) using GridSearchCV.

Model Persistence: Saves the trained model to a file (iris_classifier_model.joblib) for future use.

How to Run
Clone the repository and navigate into the project directory.

Install dependencies:

pip install pandas scikit-learn seaborn matplotlib joblib

Execute the script:

python enhanced_iris_classification.py

Results
The final, tuned Support Vector Machine (SVM) model achieved 100% accuracy on the test dataset, successfully classifying all flower samples.
